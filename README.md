# WhatToDoList
Excited to share my progress on a recent project where I'm building a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript! 🎯

Through this journey, I've deepened my understanding of:

🖥️ DOM manipulation: Creating, updating, and removing elements dynamically.
🛠️ Reusability of code: Streamlining task creation by reusing components.
🖱️ Event handling: Managing user interactions through button clicks and keyboard inputs.
💡 Problem-solving: Enhancing the functionality to update tasks efficiently rather than creating new ones repeatedly.
It's been an amazing hands-on experience, and I'm excited to keep learning and improving! 🙌
